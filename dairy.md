# DevOps Bootcamp Level 3 Final Project

## Capstone Project
I live in errors with errors 
To be honest, I forgot to write dairy until this day but I will write how I solve this project, I started with tekton then I figure out that first we need to run every service locally after a week and a half I run everything locally then I move into server and tekton. I spent four days, in super stupid mistake which is docker login.
## Errord and fix
1- add server port 8081 on application.probites file to solve tomcat port error 
2- & k proxy=8080
3- mix avalble santza in user solve crashloopback and internal server error
